<h3 id="overview-of-the-skip-gram-model">Overview of the Skip-gram Model</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: The Skip-gram model predicts context words given a target (input) word. This is the opposite of the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model, which predicts a target word from its context.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-components">Key Components</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Input Word</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Represents a single word for which we want to predict surrounding (context) words.</li>
<li>For example, given the input word &quot;sat,&quot; we want to find related words in the context, such as &quot;he,&quot; &quot;chair,&quot; etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Context Words</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>These are the words surrounding the input word. In a typical implementation, context words can be found on both sides of the input word.</li>
<li>For example, in the sentence &quot;he sat on the chair,&quot; if &quot;sat&quot; is the input word, context words could be &quot;he,&quot; &quot;on,&quot; and &quot;the.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Word Vectors</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each word is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space, using a weight matrix $W_{\text{word}}$ for input words and another matrix $W_{\text{context}}$ for context words.</li>
<li>The dimension of these vectors is typically denoted as $k$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hidden Layer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hidden layer representation is calculated as $h = W_{\text{word}} \cdot x$, where $x$ is the input word vector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="loss-function">Loss Function</h3>
<ul>
<li>The loss function for the Skip-gram model involves calculating the probability of context words given the input word.</li>
<li>The formula is often represented as:
$$
L(\theta) = -\sum_{i=1}^{d} \log(y_{w_i})
$$
where $y_{w_i}$ is the predicted probability of context word $w_i$, and $d$ is the number of context words.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="predictions">Predictions</h3>
<ul>
<li>For a single input word, the model will produce multiple context words.</li>
<li>The output layer typically uses the softmax function to convert raw scores (logits) into probabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computational Expense</strong>: The softmax function can be computationally expensive, especially with a large vocabulary size.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Negative Sampling</strong>: Instead of updating all context words, randomly sample a few negative words to update the model, thus reducing computation.</li>
<li><strong>Contrastive Estimation</strong>: This method helps improve the efficiency of the training process by contrasting positive examples (actual context words) against negative ones.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical Softmax</strong>: This method uses a tree structure to reduce the computational complexity of calculating softmax, allowing for faster training times.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Skip-gram model focuses on predicting context words from a given input word, making it a powerful tool for learning word embeddings in NLP. It leverages a hidden layer to represent the input word and uses a loss function based on cross-entropy to train the model efficiently, despite challenges related to computational cost, which can be addressed through various techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overview-of-word-context-pairs">Overview of Word-Context Pairs</h3>
<p>In natural language processing (NLP), word-context pairs are used to train models like the Skip-gram model. The idea is to learn the relationships between words and their surrounding contexts.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Correct Word-Context Pairs ($D_{wc}$)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>These are pairs of words where the context word has appeared with the target word in the training corpus.</li>
<li>Example: If we have the sentence &quot;He sat on the chair,&quot; the correct pairs can be derived as:
<ul>
<li>$(sat, on)$</li>
<li>$(sat, a)$</li>
<li>$(sat, chair)$</li>
<li>$(on, a)$</li>
<li>$(on, chair)$</li>
<li>$(a, chair)$</li>
<li>$(on, sat)$</li>
<li>$(chair, sat)$</li>
<li>$(chair, on)$</li>
<li>$(chair, a)$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the set of correct pairs can be denoted as:
$$
D_{wc} = {(sat, on), (sat, a), (sat, chair), (on, a), (on, chair), (a, chair), (on, sat), (chair, sat), (chair, on), (chair, a)}
$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incorrect Word-Context Pairs ($D_{wr}$)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>These are pairs of words where the context word has <em>not</em> appeared with the target word in the corpus.</li>
<li>To create these pairs, we randomly sample words that have never co-occurred with the target word. For example:
<ul>
<li>$(sat, oxygen)$</li>
<li>$(sat, magic)$</li>
<li>$(chair, sad)$</li>
<li>$(chair, walking)$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The incorrect pairs can be denoted as:
$$
D_{wr} = {(sat, oxygen), (sat, magic), (chair, sad), (chair, walking)}
$$</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="construction-of-sets">Construction of Sets</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Set of Correct Pairs ($D_{wc}$)</strong>: This is constructed from the training corpus by identifying all instances where words co-occur within a specified context window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set of Incorrect Pairs ($D_{wr}$)</strong>: This is constructed by randomly selecting a context word that has never been observed with the target word $w$. This sampling helps create negative examples for training, which are essential for models like Skip-gram to learn useful representations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="representation-vectors">Representation Vectors</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Word Representation ($v_w$)</strong>: Each word $w$ is represented as a vector in a continuous vector space. This representation is learned during the training process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Context Word Representation ($u_c$)</strong>: Similarly, each context word $c$ is also represented as a vector in the same vector space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-of-the-process">Summary of the Process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Collect all correct pairs $D_{wc}$ from the corpus based on actual co-occurrences.</li>
<li>Randomly sample incorrect pairs $D_{wr}$ by choosing words that have never co-occurred with the target word.</li>
<li>Use both sets of pairs to train the Skip-gram model:
<ul>
<li>The model aims to maximize the probability of correct pairs while minimizing the probability of incorrect pairs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By training on both correct and incorrect pairs, the Skip-gram model can effectively learn meaningful word embeddings that capture semantic relationships in the language.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>The goal is to <strong>maximize the probability</strong> of correct word-context pairs while minimizing the probability of incorrect pairs. This is accomplished through the use of probabilistic models and the sigmoid function.</p>
<h3 id="probability-modeling">Probability Modeling</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Probability of Correct Pair</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a given word-context pair $(w, c)$ from the set of correct pairs $D_{wc}$:
$$
P(z = 1 | w, c) = \sigma(u_c^T v_w)
$$</li>
<li>Here, $u_c$ is the context word representation, $v_w$ is the target word representation, and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function defined as:
$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Probability of Incorrect Pair</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a pair $(w, r)$ from the set of incorrect pairs $D_{wr}$:
$$
P(z = 0 | w, r) = \sigma(-u_r^T v_w)
$$</li>
<li>This indicates we want to model the probability that a randomly sampled context word $r$ is not a valid context for the target word $w$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="combining-probabilities">Combining Probabilities</h3>
<p>To derive a comprehensive objective function for training the model, we combine the probabilities from the correct and incorrect pairs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Maximizing the Product of Probabilities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overall objective can be expressed as:
$$
\text{maximize} \prod_{(w,c) \in D_{wc}} P(z = 1 | w, c) \prod_{(w,r) \in D_{wr}} P(z = 0 | w, r)
$$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logarithmic Transformation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To facilitate optimization, we take the logarithm of the product:
$$
= \text{maximize} \sum_{(w,c) \in D_{wc}} \log P(z = 1 | w, c) + \sum_{(w,r) \in D_{wr}} \log P(z = 0 | w, r)
$$</li>
<li>This turns the product into a sum, which is easier to work with mathematically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="final-objective-function">Final Objective Function</h3>
<p>Substituting the probability models into the objective function gives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Substituting Probabilities</strong>:
$$
= \text{maximize} \sum_{(w,c) \in D_{wc}} \log \sigma(u_c^T v_w) + \sum_{(w,r) \in D_{wr}} \log \sigma(-u_r^T v_w)
$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using the Sigmoid Function</strong>:
$$
= \text{maximize} \sum_{(w,c) \in D_{wc}} \log \left(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-u_c^T v_w}}\right) + \sum_{(w,r) \in D_{wr}} \log \left(\frac{1}{1 + e^{u_r^T v_w}}\right)
$$</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: The final objective function aims to maximize the likelihood of the correct word-context pairs while minimizing the likelihood of incorrect pairs.</li>
<li><strong>Dot Product</strong>: The dot product $u_c^T v_w$ and $-u_r^T v_w$ serves to quantify the similarity between the context and word embeddings, which is crucial for learning effective word representations.</li>
<li><strong>Use of the Sigmoid Function</strong>: The sigmoid function is key to mapping the outputs to probabilities, ensuring that the model outputs are in the range [0, 1].</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This mathematical framework helps to train the Skip-gram model efficiently, leveraging both positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) examples to learn meaningful embeddings for words. By maximizing the specified objective function, the model learns to distinguish valid contexts for words from those that do not co-occur, leading to better performance in various NLP tasks.</p>
<h3 id="notation-breakdown">Notation Breakdown</h3>
<ol>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>$P(z = 0 | w, r)$</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: The probability that the word-context pair $(w, r)$ is incorrect (i.e., $z = 0$).</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>$v_w$</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: The vector representation (embedding) of the target word (w).</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Similar to (u_c), this represents the target word's meaning in numerical form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>$\sigma(x)$</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: The sigmoid function, defined as $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: This function maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1, effectively converting scores (like dot products) into probabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>$u_c^T v_w$</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: Represents the sum of multiple terms.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: It aggregates the log probabilities for all pairs in $D_{wc}$ or $D_{wr}$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="overall-objective">Overall Objective</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective Function</strong>:
$$
\text{maximize} \sum_{(w,c) \in D_{wc}} \log P(z = 1 | w, c) + \sum_{(w,r) \in D_{wr}} \log P(z = 0 | w, r)
$$
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: The goal is to maximize the total log probability of correct pairs while minimizing the log probability of incorrect pairs. This helps the model learn which contexts are valid for which words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="combining-probabilities">Combining Probabilities</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Starting Equation</strong>:
$$
\text{maximize} \prod_{(w,c) \in D_{wc}} P(z = 1 | w, c) \prod_{(w,r) \in D_{wr}} P(z = 0 | w, r)
$$</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: We want to maximize the product of the probabilities that a word-context pair $(w, c)$ is correct and that a word-random context pair $(w, r)$ is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reformulation</strong>:
$$
= \text{maximize} \prod_{(w,c) \in D_{wc}} P(z = 1 | w, c) \prod_{(w,r) \in D_{wr}} (1 - P(z = 1 | w, r))
$$</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: The second term changes from $P(z = 0 | w, r)$ to $1 - P(z = 1 | w, r)$ because $P(z = 0 | w, r) = 1 - P(z = 1 | w, r)$.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Purpose of Negative Sampling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Negative sampling is used to improve the efficiency of training word embeddings by reducing the computational load associated with softmax. Instead of predicting probabilities for all words in the vocabulary, the model focuses on a few sampled words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sampling k Negative Pairs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every positive word-context pair $(w, c)$ (where $w$ is the target word and $c$ is the correct context word), the model samples <strong>k negative pairs</strong> $(w, r)$. Here, $r$ represents a randomly selected context word that is <strong>not</strong> a valid context for $w$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Size of the Dataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that there are $|D_{wc}|$ positive pairs, the total number of pairs in the dataset $D$ becomes:
$$ |D| = k \cdot |D_{wc}| $$</li>
<li>This means the size of the dataset now includes the original positive pairs plus the additional negative pairs, enhancing the learning process.</li>

<h3 id="probability-distribution-for-sampling">Probability Distribution for Sampling</h3>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Modified Unigram Distribution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The random context word $r$ is drawn from a <strong>modified unigram distribution</strong>. The probability of selecting a context word $r$ is determined based on its frequency in the corpus:

<h3 id="key-concepts-explained">Key Concepts Explained</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unigram Distribution</strong>: This is a simple probability distribution where the probability of each word is proportional to its frequency in the corpus. However, in this case, the counts are raised to the power of $3/4$ to reduce the likelihood of selecting very frequent words as negatives. This adjustment helps to balance the sampling process, making it less biased toward very common words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Number of Words $N$</strong>: The total number of words in the corpus serves as a normalizing factor. It ensures that the probabilities sum to 1 when considering all words in the vocabulary.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextual Setup</strong>:</p>

<li>Let $s$ represent the score of the positive context (e.g., for &quot;sat&quot; in &quot;He sat on a chair&quot;).</li>
<li>Let $sc$ represent the score of the negative context (e.g., for &quot;abracadabra&quot; in &quot;He sat abracadabra a chair&quot;).</li>
<li>The objective is to maximize the difference between $s$ and $sc$:
$$

$$</li>
<li>Additionally, you want this difference to be at least some margin $m$:
$$
\text{maximize } (s - (sc + m))
$$
<ul>
<li>This ensures that the positive score is not only greater than the negative score but also exceeds it by a margin $m$.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hierarchical softmax is an efficient alternative to the traditional softmax function used in training neural networks, especially in NLP tasks like word embeddings. It is designed to handle large vocabularies more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Binary Tree Structure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hierarchical softmax constructs a <strong>binary tree</strong> where:
<ul>
<li>Each <strong>leaf node</strong> corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary.</li>
<li>The number of leaf nodes is equal to the number of words, denoted as $V$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Path Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For any word $w$, there is a unique path from the <strong>root node</strong> to the leaf node representing that word.</li>
<li>Let $l(w_1), l(w_2), \ldots, l(w_p)$ be the nodes along this path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Binary Vector Encoding</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>binary vector</strong> $\pi(w)$ encodes the path from the root to the leaf node for word $w$:
<ul>
<li>$\pi(w)_k = 1$: Indicates a left branch taken at node $l(w_k)$.</li>
<li>$\pi(w)_k = 0$: Indicates a right branch taken at node $l(w_k)$.</li>

<h3 id="model-parameters">Model Parameters</h3>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Node Vectors</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <strong>internal node</strong> in the tree is associated with a vector $u_i$. These vectors are learned during training and contribute to the semantic representation of the words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The model has parameters that include:

<h3 id="how-hierarchical-softmax-works">How Hierarchical Softmax Works</h3>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p><strong>Probability Calculation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To compute the probability of a word $w$ given a context $c$ using hierarchical softmax, the model traverses the tree:
<ul>
<li>For each node in the path to the leaf node corresponding to $w$, a binary decision is made (left or right).</li>
<li>This involves calculating the sigmoid function for each internal node:
$$
P(w | c) = \prod_{k=1}^{p} \sigma(u_{l(w_k)}^T v_c)
$$</li>
<li>Here, $v_c$ is the context vector, and $u_{l(w_k)}$ is the vector associated with the internal node at position $k$ in the path to the leaf node representing $w$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The advantage of hierarchical softmax is that instead of computing the softmax over all $V$ words, it only requires a fixed number of calculations proportional to the depth of the tree (usually $\log_2 V$). This makes it significantly faster for large vocabularies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="advantages-of-hierarchical-softmax">Advantages of Hierarchical Softmax</h3>
<ol start="9">
<li>

<p><strong>Memory Efficiency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the memory footprint needed to store and compute the probabilities for word predictions, making it easier to work with large datasets.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Improved Training Speed</strong>:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Binary Tree Construction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Random Arrangement</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A practical aspect of hierarchical softmax is that the binary tree does not need to follow any specific structure regarding word semantics.</li>
<li>In practice, even a <strong>random arrangement</strong> of words on the leaf nodes of the binary tree performs well. This means that the tree can be constructed without any specific consideration of the relationships between words; as long as each word is a leaf node, the model can effectively learn word representations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why Random Works</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason a random arrangement can be effective is that the model learns the necessary semantic relationships during training based on the context in which words appear, rather than relying on the initial arrangement of the tree.</li>
<li>As the training progresses, the embeddings (representations) of the words will adjust based on their co-occurrences with context words, making the specific arrangement less critical.</li>

<h3 id="explanation-of-each-element">Explanation of Each Element</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rows and Columns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rows and columns of the matrix represent different words in the vocabulary. For example, &quot;human&quot;, &quot;machine&quot;, &quot;system&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, and &quot;user&quot; are all words from the corpus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matrix Entries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each entry in the matrix, such as the one at the intersection of &quot;human&quot; and &quot;system&quot; (0.23), represents the <strong>co-occurrence count</strong> or weight between the two words. This could denote how frequently these words appear together in the context of the surrounding text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Values</strong>: The positive values indicate how frequently the word pair occurs together. For instance, &quot;human&quot; appears in the context of &quot;for&quot; with a frequency of 2.14, suggesting that whenever &quot;for&quot; appears, &quot;human&quot; also appears often in the nearby context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Negative Values</strong>: The entry -0.13 for the co-occurrence between &quot;for&quot; and &quot;user&quot; could suggest an unusual or rare negative association, or it could indicate a reduced count or weight in the context, possibly hinting at infrequent co-occurrences or adjustments made during preprocessing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="purpose-of-the-co-occurrence-matrix">Purpose of the Co-occurrence Matrix</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Semantic Relationships</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This matrix serves as a representation of semantic relationships between words based on their co-occurrence patterns in the corpus. Words that frequently occur together tend to be semantically related.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Word Vector Learning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In models like GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), this co-occurrence matrix is used to train word vectors. The goal is to learn a set of word embeddings (vector representations) such that the dot product of the vectors reflects the log probability of the co-occurrence counts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextual Information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The matrix captures contextual information. For example, words that share common contexts (like &quot;human&quot; and &quot;machine&quot;) can be grouped or represented similarly in a high-dimensional vector space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dimensionality Reduction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-dimensional co-occurrence matrices can be reduced to lower-dimensional vector representations (embeddings), making them easier to work with for various natural language processing tasks such as classification, clustering, and semantic analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The co-occurrence matrix is a crucial element in natural language processing, enabling the extraction of meaningful relationships between words based on their usage in context. By analyzing these co-occurrences, models can learn to represent words in a way that captures their meanings and relationships in a mathematically tractable format.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-semantic-relatedness">1. Semantic Relatedness</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Semantic relatedness measures how closely related two words are in meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Human Judgments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans are asked to judge the relatedness between pairs of words. For example, given the pair <strong>(cat, dog)</strong>, a human might assign a score of $$ S_{\text{human}}(\text{cat, dog}) = 0.8 $$, indicating a high degree of relatedness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Computation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute the cosine similarity between the word vectors corresponding to the two words:
$$
S_{\text{model}}(\text{cat, dog}) = \frac{v_{\text{cat}}^T v_{\text{dog}}}{|v_{\text{cat}}| |v_{\text{dog}}|}
$$</li>
<li>If the model's cosine similarity for the same pair is $$ S_{\text{model}}(\text{cat, dog}) = 0.7 $$, it suggests a good, but not perfect, alignment with human judgment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a large dataset of word pairs, compute the correlation between the model’s scores ($$ S_{\text{model}} $$) and human judgments ($$ S_{\text{human}} $$).</li>
<li>Compare different models:
<ul>
<li><strong>Model 1</strong> is considered better than <strong>Model 2</strong> if:
$$
\text{correlation}(S_{\text{model}<em>1}, S</em>{\text{human}}) &gt; \text{correlation}(S_{\text{model}<em>2}, S</em>{\text{human}})
$$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-synonym-detection">2. Synonym Detection</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The task of identifying a synonym for a given term from a list of candidates.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Term</strong>: <em>levied</em></li>
<li><strong>Candidates</strong>: <em>unposed, believed, requested, correlated</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Computation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each candidate, compute the cosine similarity with the term:
$$
\text{Synonym} = \text{argmax}<em>{c \in C} \left(\frac{v</em>{\text{term}}^T v_{c}}{|v_{\text{term}}| |v_{c}|}\right)
$$</li>
<li>Select the candidate with the largest cosine similarity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute the accuracy of different models based on how many times they correctly identify the synonym.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-analogy">3. Analogy</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The task of solving analogies, typically framed as &quot;A is to B as C is to D.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Semantic Analogy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Find the nearest neighbor for <strong>sister</strong> using the relation:
$$
v_{\text{brother}} + v_{\text{grandson}} \approx v_{\text{sister}} + v_{\text{?}}
$$</li>
<li>This implies searching for a vector $$ v_{?} $$ that maintains the semantic relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Syntactic Analogy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Work with syntactic relationships:
$$
v_{\text{works}} - v_{\text{work}} + v_{\text{speak}} \approx v_{\text{?}}
$$</li>
<li>This reflects a different aspect of word relationships based on grammatical forms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluating Algorithms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boroni et al. (2014)</strong> found that predictive models (like Word2Vec) consistently outperform count-based models (like GloVe) in all evaluation tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Levy et al. (2015)</strong> conducted a thorough analysis and found that:
<ul>
<li>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) performed better than prediction-based models on similarity tasks.</li>
<li>Prediction-based models excelled on analogy tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship between <strong>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)</strong> and <strong>Word2Vec</strong> lies in how both techniques approach the task of generating word embeddings from co-occurrence information in a corpus.</p>
<h3 id="1-matrix-factorization">1. Matrix Factorization</h3>
<p><strong>SVD</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SVD is a technique used to factorize a matrix into three components:
$$
M \approx U \Sigma V^T
$$</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong>: Original matrix (e.g., a co-occurrence matrix).</li>
<li><strong>U</strong>: Left singular vectors (representations of words).</li>
<li><strong>Σ</strong>: Diagonal matrix containing singular values.</li>
<li><strong>V^T</strong>: Right singular vectors (representations of context).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of word embeddings, SVD operates on a co-occurrence matrix that captures how often words appear together across the corpus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Word2Vec</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Word2Vec, particularly in its Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram models, also performs a form of matrix factorization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does this indirectly by learning two separate weight matrices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>W_context</strong>: Represents context words.</li>
<li><strong>W_word</strong>: Represents target words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These matrices can be thought of as learned embeddings for words and their contexts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-relationship-between-the-models">2. Relationship Between the Models</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Levy et al. (2015) showed that Word2Vec can be seen as performing an implicit matrix factorization of a certain matrix <strong>M</strong> that relates to the <strong>Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)</strong> matrix:
$$
M = W_{\text{context}} W_{\text{word}}
$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PMI</strong> is a measure of association between two words and is computed as:
$$
\text{PMI}(w_i, c_j) = \log \left( \frac{P(w_i, c_j)}{P(w_i) P(c_j)} \right)
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>Where $P(w_i, c_j)$ is the joint probability of words $w_i$ and context $c_j$, and $P(w_i)$ and $P(c_j)$ are the individual probabilities of $w_i$ and $c_j$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The matrix <strong>M</strong> can also be expressed in terms of a modified co-occurrence matrix where:
$$
M_{ij} = \text{PMI}(w_i, c_j) \cdot \log(k)
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>$k$ is the number of negative samples used in the Word2Vec training process, and it adjusts the influence of negative samples on learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-implications-of-the-relationship">3. Implications of the Relationship</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both SVD and Word2Vec aim to represent word meanings based on their usage in context. The primary difference is in their approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SVD</strong> operates directly on a full co-occurrence matrix, which can be computationally expensive for large vocabularies.</li>
<li><strong>Word2Vec</strong> learns embeddings through stochastic gradient descent, optimizing for prediction tasks (such as predicting context words given a target word) rather than directly modeling co-occurrences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insight that Word2Vec performs an implicit matrix factorization helps understand why both methods can yield similar embeddings under certain conditions, despite their different operational mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In conclusion, while SVD and Word2Vec employ different methodologies, both are fundamentally about uncovering relationships between words based on co-occurrence data. Word2Vec can be viewed as an efficient, scalable method for performing a type of matrix factorization similar to that of SVD, allowing it to produce high-quality word embeddings for various natural language processing tasks.</p>
