Defaults to\n            \"none\" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets\n            \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\") if `orientation` is \"v\" (\"h\") Use\n            with `fillcolor` if not \"none\". \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\"\n            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. \"tonextx\" and\n            \"tonexty\" fill between the endpoints of this trace and\n            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those\n            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area\n            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave\n            like \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\". \"toself\" connects the\n            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if\n            it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the\n            space between two traces if one completely encloses the\n            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like\n            \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\"\n            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the\n            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or\n            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With\n            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some\n            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,\n            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing\n            order.\n        fillcolor\n            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent\n            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line\n            color, whichever is available. If fillgradient is\n            specified, fillcolor is ignored except for setting the\n            background color of the hover label, if any.\n        fillgradient\n            Sets a fill gradient. If not specified, the fillcolor\n            is used instead.\n        fillpattern\n            Sets the pattern within the marker.\n        groupnorm\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of\n            this `stackgroup`. With \"fraction\", the value of each\n            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all\n            trace values at that location. \"percent\" is the same\n            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are\n            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one\n            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hoveron\n            Do the hover effects highlight individual points\n            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled\n            regions? If the fill is \"toself\" or \"tonext\" and there\n            are no markers or text, then the default is \"fills\",\n            otherwise it is \"points\".\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            \"<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>\". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a \"text\" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are \"legend\", \"legend2\",\n            \"legend3\", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes\n            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same\n            time when toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Legendgrouptitle`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with \"reversed\" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes \"text\" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Only relevant in the following cases: 1. when\n            `scattermode` is set to \"group\". 2. when `stackgroup`\n            is used, and only the first `orientation` found in the\n            `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is\n            \"legendonly\" but not if it is `false`. Sets the\n            stacking direction. With \"v\" (\"h\"), the y (x) values of\n            subsequent traces are added. Also affects the default\n            value of `fill`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stackgaps\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at\n            which other traces in this group have data but this one\n            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these\n            locations. With \"interpolate\" we linearly interpolate\n            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant\n            beyond the existing values.\n        stackgroup\n            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the\n            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or\n            their x values if `orientation` is \"h\"). If blank or\n            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also\n            turns `fill` on by default, using \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\")\n            if `orientation` is \"h\" (\"v\") and sets the default\n            `mode` to \"lines\" irrespective of point count. You can\n            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in\n            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)\n            other traces in the same group. With multiple\n            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if\n            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the\n            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a \"text\" flag and\n            \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects\n            to the (x,y) coordinates.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x\n            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\".

When `x0period` is round number\n            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a\n            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at\n            2000-01-01.\n        xperiodalignment\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\".

Builds a linear space of y\n            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dy` the step.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If \"y2\", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        ycalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.\n        yhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.\n        yperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or \"M<n>\" on the y\n            axis. Special values in the form of \"M<n>\" could be\n            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`\n            must be a positive integer.\n        yperiod0\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date\n            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number\n            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a\n            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at\n            2000-01-01.\n        yperiodalignment\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            alignment of data points on the y axis.\n        ysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `y`.\n        zorder\n            Sets the layer on which this trace is displayed,\n            relative to other SVG traces on the same subplot. SVG\n            traces with higher `zorder` appear in front of those\n            with lower `zorder`.\n        \nDid you mean \"connectgaps\"?\n\nBad property path:\ncontours_showlabels\n^^^^^^^^",

If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a \"text\" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum.

Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with \"reversed\" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes \"text\" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Only relevant in the following cases: 1. when\n            `scattermode` is set to \"group\". 2. when `stackgroup`\n            is used, and only the first `orientation` found in the\n            `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is\n            \"legendonly\" but not if it is `false`. Sets the\n            stacking direction. With \"v\" (\"h\"), the y (x) values of\n            subsequent traces are added. Also affects the default\n            value of `fill`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stackgaps\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at\n            which other traces in this group have data but this one\n            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these\n            locations. With \"interpolate\" we linearly interpolate\n            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant\n            beyond the existing values.\n        stackgroup\n            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the\n            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or\n            their x values if `orientation` is \"h\"). If blank or\n            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also\n            turns `fill` on by default, using \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\")\n            if `orientation` is \"h\" (\"v\") and sets the default\n            `mode` to \"lines\" irrespective of point count. You can\n            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in\n            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)\n            other traces in the same group. With multiple\n            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if\n            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the\n            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a \"text\" flag and\n            \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects\n            to the (x,y) coordinates.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x\n            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\".
