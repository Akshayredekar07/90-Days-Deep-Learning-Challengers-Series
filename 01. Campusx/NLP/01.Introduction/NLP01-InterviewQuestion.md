## **Q1 Explain what is NLP?**

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and process human languages in a meaningful way.

### 2. **main Objectives**
- **Comprehension**: Teaching computers to understand the meaning and context of words and phrases.
- **Generation**: Enabling machines to generate human-like text that can communicate effectively.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing text to determine the sentiment behind it, whether positive, negative, or neutral.

### 3. **Common NLP Applications**
Speech Recognition, Text Summarization, Named Entity Recognition, Question Answering, Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation, Chatbots, Autocorrect and Autosuggest, Speech Synthesis.


### 4. **Techniques Used in NLP**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) employs a range of techniques to analyze, understand, and generate human language. Key techniques include **tokenization**, **part-of-speech tagging**, **named entity recognition**, **dependency parsing**, **semantic role labeling**, **coreference resolution**, **sentiment analysis**, **topic modeling**. These techniques enable NLP to break down text into individual words or tokens, identify grammatical categories, detect and classify key entities, analyze sentence structure, identify roles played by entities, resolve pronoun relationships, determine emotional tone, identify underlying topics, and train models for predictions.

### 5. **Challenges in NLP**
- **Ambiguity**: Words can have multiple meanings depending on context.
- **Sarcasm and Humor**: Understanding these nuances in language is extremely difficult for machines.
